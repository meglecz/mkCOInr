Overview of mkCOInr
=================================================

mkCOInr is a series of Perl scripts that aims to create **COInr, a large, comprehensive, COI database from NCBI-nucleotide and BOLD**. 

The COInr database is composed of two files
    - :ref:`COInr.tsv <sequence_tsv_with_taxid_io>`, that contains :ref:`sequenceIDs <seqid_glossary>`, :ref:`taxIDs <taxid_glossary>` and sequences
    - :ref:`taxonomy.tsv <taxonomy_io>` that contains all taxIDs and associated information

COInr is freely available and can be easily downloaded from `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6555985>`_

It is planned to produce a new version annually. 

Further scripts allow users to customize the database.

Major features of the creation of mkCOInr:
    - Mass download of sequences and their taxonomic lineages from NCBI-nucleotide and BOLD databases
    - TaxIDs are used to avoid problems with homonyms and synonyms
    - Creation of a coherent taxID system. The hierarchical structure of the NCBI taxIDs is completed if necessary with new, negative taxIDs. 
    - When adding sequences with unknown taxIDs, taxon names are matched to already existing taxonomic lineages in the database to identify a correct existing taxID, or to assign a new one.
    - Taxonomically aware demultiplexing
    - Creation of a ready-to-use database in BLAST, RDP_classifier QIIME, VTAM or a FULL tsv format

**COInr**
    - Is not specific to a particular region of the COI gene. Sequences can be partial and can cover any part of the COI gene. 
    - All cellular organisms are included, even Bacteria. 
    - Sequences with incomplete lineages (e.g. assigned to a family without further precision) are present in the database
    - Taxa are taken into account only with correct latin name formats (e.g. instead of 'Proterorhinus sp. BOLD:EUFWF4948-19', the sequence is assigned to *Proterorhinus* genus without a species name)

The database can be used directly for similarity-based taxonomic assignations of metabarcoding data with any COI marker (primer pairs) of any geographical regions or target group.

Alternatively, the **database can be used as a starting point to create smaller, more specific custom databases**. 

Sequences can be selected for :

    - A particular gene region (amplicon of a given primer pair) using :ref:`select_region <select_region_reference>`
    - List of taxa (sequences of a taxon list can be either selected or eliminated) using :ref:`select_taxa <select_taxa_reference>`
    - User-defined minimal taxonomic resolution using :ref:`select_taxa <select_taxa_reference>`
	
Additionally, it is also possible to **add custom sequences**.

This can save a considerable amount of time and effort, since one of the most important challenges of creating a custom database is the mass downloading of the sequences and their pooling into a coherent taxonomic system.

COInr or the custom databases derived from it **can be formated to different database formats** (qiime, rdp, blast, vtam, full) by :ref:`format_db <format_db_reference>`

**Further precisions**

    - The taxonomic origin of the sequences is not checked, but taken as a face value from the source database. 
    - At the scale of the complete database I did not find a satisfactory method to blacklist sequences that are probably incorrectly assigned. However, if a small custom database is produced, the use of a phylogenetic method like `SATIVA <https://github.com/amkozlov/sativa>`_ becomes feasible and recommended to eliminate sequences of dubious origin.
